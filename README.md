# Drone Cluster Path Planning ðŸš€

This repository contains my solution to the *Aerokart Internship Assignment*.  
It simulates two clusters of drones moving from a start point to a target while avoiding an obstacle, and visualizes their paths.

## âœ¨ Features
- Two independent drone clusters (*5 drones each*)  
- Random path generation from *Start â†’ Target*  
- Visualization of:
  - âœ… Start point (green diamond)  
  - âœ… Target (black star)  
  - âœ… Obstacle (red X)  
  - âœ… Drone paths (Cluster A = circles, Cluster B = squares)
